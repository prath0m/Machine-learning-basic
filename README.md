# Data Analysis and Machine Learning with Pandas and Scikit-learn

This project demonstrates how to use Pandas for data manipulation and scikit-learn for building machine learning models in Python. The project includes examples of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models.

## Features

- **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Use Pandas to load, clean, and preprocess data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA to understand data distributions, correlations, and trends.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and select features for model training.
- **Model Building**: Train machine learning models using scikit-learn, including regression, classification, and clustering models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate models using various metrics and cross-validation.
- **Pipeline Creation**: Build end-to-end data processing and modeling pipelines.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.6 or later
- The following Python packages:
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (optional, for data visualization)
  - `seaborn` (optional, for enhanced visualizations)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pandas-sklearn-project.git
